# PageWatcher - Tool for watching changes on specific site

In my case it watches tickets on https://msk.kassir.ru/koncert/ok-lujniki/metallica-worldwired-tour-2019_2019-07-21 and send me a message via telegram bot if there are some tickets avaliable.

It was originally done in JS: https://github.com/hostile-d/PageWatcher.js, then I desided to investigate .Net MVC while doing this small project.
